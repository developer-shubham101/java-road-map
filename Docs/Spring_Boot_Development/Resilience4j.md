**Resilience4j** is a lightweight, easy-to-use fault tolerance library for Java, designed specifically for microservices and distributed systems. It helps in implementing **resilience patterns** like **Circuit Breaker**, **Rate Limiter**, **Retry**, **Bulkhead**, and **Time Limiter**. It integrates well with **Spring Boot**, making it a popular choice for ensuring fault tolerance in Spring applications.

Resilience4j is inspired by **Netflix Hystrix**, but it's more lightweight and provides better integration with modern Java features like `CompletableFuture`, `Stream`, `Optional`, and Lambda expressions.

### **Why Use Resilience4j in Spring Boot?**
In distributed systems, microservices need to handle failures like:
- Temporary network issues.
- Service outages.
- High latency.

Resilience4j provides mechanisms to make your services more resilient against such failures, improving the overall stability and fault tolerance of your application.

### **Core Modules of Resilience4j**

Resilience4j offers several key resilience patterns:

1. **Circuit Breaker**:
   A Circuit Breaker monitors calls to a remote service and temporarily "opens" (blocks calls) if the service fails beyond a certain threshold. Once the service stabilizes, the circuit closes, allowing traffic to pass through.

2. **Retry**:
   Retry logic automatically retries failed calls, allowing the remote service a chance to recover from intermittent failures.

3. **Rate Limiter**:
   Limits the number of calls to a service in a defined period to avoid overloading the system.

4. **Bulkhead**:
   Bulkhead isolates different parts of the system to prevent one service or function from consuming all the resources and affecting others.

5. **Time Limiter**:
   Ensures that calls to external services have a timeout. If a call takes too long, it fails.

### **Setting up Resilience4j in a Spring Boot Application**

You can integrate Resilience4j into a Spring Boot project using the `spring-boot-starter-aop` and `resilience4j-spring-boot2` dependencies. Here's how to do that:

#### **Step 1: Add Dependencies**
To start using Resilience4j in a Spring Boot project, add the following dependencies in your `pom.xml` if you're using Maven:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.resilience4j</groupId>
    <artifactId>resilience4j-spring-boot2</artifactId>
    <version>1.7.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-aop</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

If you're using **Gradle**, add the following to your `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
implementation 'io.github.resilience4j:resilience4j-spring-boot2:1.7.0'
implementation 'org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-aop'
```

### **Using Different Resilience Patterns in Spring Boot**

#### **1. Circuit Breaker**
The Circuit Breaker pattern prevents the system from performing an operation repeatedly when it is likely to fail, avoiding cascading failures.

Hereâ€™s how to configure and use a Circuit Breaker in a Spring Boot service.

##### **Step 1: Configure Circuit Breaker in `application.properties`**

```properties
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.myService.failureRateThreshold=50
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.myService.slowCallRateThreshold=50
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.myService.waitDurationInOpenState=10s
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.myService.permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState=3
resilience4j.circuitbreaker.instances.myService.slidingWindowSize=10
```

##### **Step 2: Apply Circuit Breaker in Code**

```java
import io.github.resilience4j.circuitbreaker.annotation.CircuitBreaker;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    @CircuitBreaker(name = "myService", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public String callExternalService() {
        // Simulating a call to an external service that might fail
        if (new Random().nextBoolean()) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Failed to call external service");
        }
        return "Success";
    }

    public String fallback(Exception e) {
        return "Fallback response due to exception: " + e.getMessage();
    }
}
```

- The `@CircuitBreaker` annotation defines the method `callExternalService()` to be wrapped with a Circuit Breaker.
- The `fallbackMethod` is called when the external service fails.

#### **2. Retry**
The Retry pattern automatically retries the execution of a failed method for a given number of attempts.

##### **Step 1: Configure Retry in `application.properties`**

```properties
resilience4j.retry.instances.myService.maxAttempts=5
resilience4j.retry.instances.myService.waitDuration=1s
```

##### **Step 2: Apply Retry in Code**

```java
import io.github.resilience4j.retry.annotation.Retry;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Retry(name = "myService", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public String callExternalService() {
        // Simulating a call to an external service that might fail
        if (new Random().nextBoolean()) {
            throw new RuntimeException("Failed to call external service");
        }
        return "Success";
    }

    public String fallback(Exception e) {
        return "Fallback after retries due to: " + e.getMessage();
    }
}
```

In this example, Resilience4j will retry the failed method up to 5 times with a 1-second delay between each attempt.

#### **3. Rate Limiter**
The Rate Limiter restricts the number of calls allowed within a specific time period, preventing system overloads.

##### **Step 1: Configure Rate Limiter in `application.properties`**

```properties
resilience4j.ratelimiter.instances.myService.limitForPeriod=5
resilience4j.ratelimiter.instances.myService.limitRefreshPeriod=10s
resilience4j.ratelimiter.instances.myService.timeoutDuration=5s
```

##### **Step 2: Apply Rate Limiter in Code**

```java
import io.github.resilience4j.ratelimiter.annotation.RateLimiter;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    @RateLimiter(name = "myService", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public String callExternalService() {
        return "External service call succeeded";
    }

    public String fallback(Throwable t) {
        return "Rate limit exceeded: " + t.getMessage();
    }
}
```

This Rate Limiter allows 5 requests in every 10-second period. If the rate exceeds this, the fallback method is called.

#### **4. Bulkhead**
The Bulkhead pattern isolates parts of the system so that if one service fails or experiences high load, it doesn't affect other parts of the system.

##### **Step 1: Configure Bulkhead in `application.properties`**

```properties
resilience4j.bulkhead.instances.myService.maxConcurrentCalls=10
resilience4j.bulkhead.instances.myService.maxWaitDuration=500ms
```

##### **Step 2: Apply Bulkhead in Code**

```java
import io.github.resilience4j.bulkhead.annotation.Bulkhead;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Bulkhead(name = "myService", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public String callExternalService() {
        return "External service call succeeded";
    }

    public String fallback(Throwable t) {
        return "Service overloaded: " + t.getMessage();
    }
}
```

This configuration ensures that no more than 10 concurrent calls can be made to the `callExternalService` method.

#### **5. Time Limiter**
The Time Limiter ensures that calls to a service fail after a specified timeout.

##### **Step 1: Configure Time Limiter in `application.properties`**

```properties
resilience4j.timelimiter.instances.myService.timeoutDuration=2s
```

##### **Step 2: Apply Time Limiter in Code**

```java
import io.github.resilience4j.timelimiter.annotation.TimeLimiter;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;
import java.util.concurrent.CompletableFuture;

@Service
public class MyService {

    @TimeLimiter(name = "myService", fallbackMethod = "fallback")
    public CompletableFuture<String> callExternalService() {
        return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
            try {
                Thread.sleep(3000);  // Simulate long call
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();
            }
            return "External service call succeeded";
        });
    }

    public CompletableFuture<String> fallback(Throwable t) {
        return CompletableFuture.completedFuture("Request timed out: " + t.getMessage());
    }
}
```

If the external service takes more than 2 seconds, the Time Limiter triggers the fallback method.
