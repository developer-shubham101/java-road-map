**Parallelism** and **Concurrency** are two concepts in computer science that are often confused but represent different approaches to handling tasks. Let’s break down the differences:

### 1. **Concurrency**:
   - **Definition**: Concurrency refers to the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks **by interleaving their execution**. The tasks can start, run, and complete in overlapping time periods.
   - **Execution**: In concurrency, tasks may or may not run simultaneously. Instead, they are **interleaved** so that multiple tasks progress. The system switches between tasks (threads or processes) to give the appearance of parallel execution.
   - **Use Case**: Useful when you have multiple tasks that can be performed independently but share a resource (e.g., CPU or I/O), such as in web servers or user interface applications.
   - **Example**: In a single-core processor, concurrency allows multiple threads to run by switching between them frequently. Each thread may perform a part of its task before switching to another thread.

     **Analogy**: Imagine you're at a restaurant, and the waiter is taking orders from multiple tables. They don’t handle one table at a time from start to finish but instead switch between tables, taking and delivering orders. The waiter does one thing at a time but handles multiple tasks by alternating between them.

### 2. **Parallelism**:
   - **Definition**: Parallelism refers to **actually executing multiple tasks simultaneously**. In parallelism, tasks are broken down into subtasks that can be executed at the same time on multiple processors or cores.
   - **Execution**: Parallelism requires **multiple physical processing units** (like multiple cores in a CPU or different processors) to execute tasks at the same time.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for tasks that can be broken down into smaller independent units that can run at the same time, like scientific simulations, video processing, or distributed computing tasks.
   - **Example**: On a multi-core processor, parallelism allows several threads to execute simultaneously on different cores.

     **Analogy**: Imagine the same restaurant with multiple waiters. Each waiter serves one table at a time, but now multiple tables can be served simultaneously by different waiters.

### Key Differences:
| Feature            | Concurrency                                  | Parallelism                                 |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Execution**      | Tasks are interleaved (may not run at the same time). | Tasks run simultaneously (at the same time).|
| **Processor usage**| Can work on a single processor (time-sharing).| Requires multiple processors or cores.      |
| **Goal**           | Handle multiple tasks by switching between them. | Speed up execution by dividing tasks.       |
| **Example**        | A web server handling multiple users’ requests by switching between them. | Dividing a big matrix computation across multiple cores. |
| **Requirement**    | Works even with a single-core CPU.            | Needs a multi-core or distributed system.   |

### Summary:
- **Concurrency** is about **dealing with lots of things at once**, while **parallelism** is about **doing lots of things at once**.
- Concurrency involves structuring the program to handle multiple tasks by switching between them (even on a single core), while parallelism involves running multiple tasks simultaneously on multiple cores.
