### **Major Highlights:**
1. **Java 1.0 (1996)**: The original release, introducing applets and basic object-oriented features.
2. **Java 1.2 (1998)**: Introduction of the **Collections Framework** and **Swing** for GUI development.
3. **Java 5 (2004)**: Added **Generics**, **Annotations**, and **Enums**—key features that made Java more expressive.
4. **Java 8 (2014)**: Introduced **lambdas.Lambdas** and the **Stream API**, marking one of the most significant changes in the language.
5. **Java 9 (2017)**: The **Modular System (Project Jigsaw)** was introduced, allowing better dependency management and modularity.
6. **Java 11 (2018)**: Long Term Support (LTS) version, crucial for enterprises.
7. **Java 17 (2021)**: Another **LTS** version with new features like **sealed classes**, **pattern matching**, and more.

Java’s release model changed after **Java 9**, with **feature-based releases every six months**. This means Java now has faster, more incremental updates. Additionally, every few years, certain releases are designated as **LTS (Long Term Support)** versions, which receive extended support and are favored by enterprise environments. The latest LTS versions are **Java 8, 11, and 17**.
